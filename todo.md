- P1: GUI (setup)
    - [ ] Test on ICOS Jupyter hub 
    - [ ] (re) implement connection with TM5
    - [ ] implement only configuration with 3 level zoom: globa/Europe/NL+D+CH
- P4: GUI (extension)
    - [ ] implement possibility to upload self emissions
    - [ ] (re) implement possibility to pass defaults through a YAML file
    - [ ] implement a few default configurations
    - [ ] implement section(s) for observations
- P3: TM5
    - [ ] diagnose issue with concentrations decreasing too fast (i.e. sink too strong?)
    - [ ] -> mv to check preprocessing of emission for climatological files
    - [ ] -> gm to test 1 month simulation with regional zoom
    - [ ] -> mv to prepare the met forcing for the zoom configurations
- P5: TM5 speedup
    - [ ] speedup chemistry
    - [ ] speedup emissions
- P6: TM5 analyses, open questions regarding our initial TM5 runs with prior emission fields: to be addressed with long run on COSMOS:
    - repeat experiment with initial conditon, e.g. from CAMS, so the initial spatial gradient is realistic
    -> MV, txk to check 
    - simulated variability of Cabauw appears too small. It is primarily driven by changes in boundary layer height and wind direction
    -> MV, txk to check effect of vertical resolution
- P2: GUI (analysis)
    - [ ] plot continuous timeseries at requested stations
    - [ ] plot comparison with observations
    - [ ] automated plot with emissions budget by region and category
    - [ ] Automated observation fit statistics
- Documentation
    - [ ] properly setup github pages with mkdocs
    - avoid misuse through implementation of "accepted ranges"
    - could be overleaf or a shared word document ...
    - https://lumia.nateko.lu.se/ using a package mkdoc,
      could be combined with a markedown file on nextcloud ...
- Advanced GUI (ideas for later ...):
    - [ ] Comparison between two (or more?) simulations
