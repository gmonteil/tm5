- GUI (setup)
    - [ ] Test on ICOS Jupyter hub 
    - [ ] (re) implement connection with TM5
    - [ ] implement possibility to upload self emissions
    - [ ] (re) implement possibility to pass defaults through a YAML file
    - [ ] implement a few default configurations
    - [ ] implement section(s) for observations
- TM5
    - [ ] speedup chemistry
    - [ ] speedup emissions
    - [ ] diagnose issue with concentrations decreasing too fast (i.e. sink too strong?)
- GUI (analysis)
    - [ ] plot continuous timeseries at requested stations
    - [ ] plot comparison with observations
    - [ ] automated plot with emissions budget by region and category
    - [ ] Automated observation fit statistics
