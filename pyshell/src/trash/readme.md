Here are source files that (I think) are no longer relevant, at least for 4dvar inversions:
- bc_read_processed.F90 => read boundary condition (whatever that is) from an HDF file
- em_read_processed.F90 => read emissions from an HDF file
- tipp_grid_tools.F90 => does anyone still use TIPP?
- var4d_io_tools.F90 => irrelevant since inversion stuff have been moved out of the fortran code.
